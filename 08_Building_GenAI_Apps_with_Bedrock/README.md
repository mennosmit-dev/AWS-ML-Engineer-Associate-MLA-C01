# 08 — Building Generative AI Applications with Bedrock

## Professional Focus
Move from “LLM knowledge” to “LLM systems”: build GenAI apps with RAG, guardrails, agents, and evaluation patterns.

## What This Enables Me To Do
- Build GenAI apps using Bedrock foundation models
- Implement RAG with knowledge bases + embeddings + vector stores
- Apply guardrails and content filtering
- Build agentic workflows with Bedrock Agents + action groups
- Understand model access, evaluation, and operational features

## AWS Services / Concepts Covered
- Amazon Bedrock (playground, evaluation, studio)
- Knowledge Bases (embeddings/vector stores)
- RAG chunking strategies\n- Guardrails
- Bedrock Agents + action groups
- OpenSearch cleanup warnings (operational hygiene)
