# 08 — Building Generative AI Applications with Bedrock

## Professional Focus
Move from “LLM knowledge” to “LLM systems”: build GenAI apps with RAG, guardrails, agents, and evaluation patterns.

## What This Enables Me To Do
- Build GenAI apps using Bedrock foundation models\n- Implement RAG with knowledge bases + embeddings + vector stores\n- Apply guardrails and content filtering\n- Build agentic workflows with Bedrock Agents + action groups\n- Understand model access, evaluation, and operational features

## AWS Services / Concepts Covered
- Amazon Bedrock (playground, evaluation, studio)\n- Knowledge Bases (embeddings/vector stores)\n- RAG chunking strategies\n- Guardrails\n- Bedrock Agents + action groups\n- OpenSearch cleanup warnings (operational hygiene)

## Interview-Ready Takeaways
- I can describe how to build an enterprise-grade RAG system on AWS\n- I can explain risk controls (guardrails) and why they matter in production\n- I understand agents as system orchestration, not magic

## Lecture Map (for navigation)
- Bedrock foundations + access notes\n- Labs: playground + RAG system + guardrails + agent build\n- Quiz
