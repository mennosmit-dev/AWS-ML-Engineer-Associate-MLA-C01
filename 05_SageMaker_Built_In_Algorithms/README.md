# 05 — SageMaker Built-In Algorithms

## Professional Focus
Build speed and pragmatism: know when SageMaker built-ins solve problems efficiently and how to select them.

## What This Enables Me To Do
- Identify which SageMaker built-in algorithm fits a problem type\n- Understand input modes and operational constraints\n- Apply algorithms across NLP, vision, anomaly detection, recommendation-style embeddings, and classical ML

## AWS Services / Concepts Covered
- SageMaker built-ins: Linear Learner, XGBoost, LightGBM, Seq2Seq, DeepAR, BlazingText, Object2Vec\n- Vision: Object Detection, Image Classification, Semantic Segmentation\n- Anomaly/Topics: Random Cut Forest, Neural Topic Model, LDA\n- Clustering/DR: KNN, K-Means, PCA\n- Factorization Machines, IP Insights

## Interview-Ready Takeaways
- I can discuss algorithm choice as an engineering decision (speed, scale, constraints)\n- I understand SageMaker input patterns and where issues arise

## Lecture Map (for navigation)
- SageMaker intro + input modes\n- Built-in algorithm survey + quiz

## Evidence I’ll add (optional)
- notes/
- lab-notes/
- diagrams/
