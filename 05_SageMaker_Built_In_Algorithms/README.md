# 05 — SageMaker Built-In Algorithms

## Professional Focus
Build speed and pragmatism: know when SageMaker built-ins solve problems efficiently and how to select them.

## What This Enables Me To Do
- Identify which SageMaker built-in algorithm fits a problem type
- Understand input modes and operational constraints
- Apply algorithms across NLP, vision, anomaly detection, recommendation-style embeddings, and classical ML

## AWS Services / Concepts Covered
- SageMaker built-ins: Linear Learner, XGBoost, LightGBM, Seq2Seq, DeepAR, BlazingText, Object2Vec
- Vision: Object Detection, Image Classification, Semantic Segmentation
- Anomaly/Topics: Random Cut Forest, Neural Topic Model, LDA
- Clustering/DR: KNN, K-Means, PCA\n- Factorization Machines, IP Insights
