# AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer – Associate (MLA-C01) — Learning Repo

This repository documents what I’m learning while preparing for the **AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer – Associate (MLA-C01 / ME1-C01)** exam, with a focus on **real-world ML engineering on AWS**.

(Udemy lecture pages may require login; this repo links to the public course landing page.)

## 🎯 What this repo demonstrates (recruiter-friendly)
- **Applied AWS ML engineering skills**: data ingestion, processing, training, deployment, monitoring, and governance on AWS
- **Service fluency**: Amazon **SageMaker**, **Bedrock**, and key supporting AWS services (S3, IAM, Kinesis, Glue, CloudWatch, etc.)
- **Production mindset**: security, cost optimization, observability, scalability, and operational best practices

---

## 🧠 Why I’m doing this
The MLA-C01 is one of the more demanding cloud certifications because it tests both:
- **Machine learning competence**, and
- **How to ship and operate ML systems on AWS**

I’m using this repo as a structured knowledge base that I can reference in real projects and interviews.

## 🛠 What I’m focusing on (skills)
- Data ingestion & storage patterns for ML (S3, streaming, lake/lakehouse concepts)
- Feature engineering at scale (Spark/EMR, Glue, Wrangler, Feature Store)
- Model training & tuning in SageMaker (built-ins, HPO, experiments, registry)
- GenAI foundations + practical Bedrock workflows (RAG, knowledge bases, guardrails, agents)
- MLOps pipelines (deployment strategies, monitoring, scaling, automation)
- Security & governance (IAM, KMS, VPC, logging, budgets, compliance)

## 📁 Repo conventions
Each section folder includes:
- **What this enables me to do**
- **Key AWS services covered**
- **Interview-ready takeaways**
- Space for labs / notes if I choose to add them
