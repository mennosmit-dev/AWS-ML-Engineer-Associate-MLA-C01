# 07 — Generative AI Model Fundamentals

## Professional Focus
Build a strong conceptual base for transformers and LLMs so design decisions are grounded, not buzzword-driven.

## What This Enables Me To Do
- Understand transformer mechanics (attention, tokens, embeddings)
- Know what fine-tuning vs transfer learning means for LLMs
- Practice notebooks/labs that connect theory to implementation
- Understand how AWS positions foundation models and JumpStart

## AWS Services / Concepts Covered
- Transformers, attention, tokens/embeddings/temperature
- Fine-tuning vs transfer learning\n- SageMaker notebooks labs
- JumpStart + Hugging Face workflows
