# 06 — Model Training, Tuning, and Evaluation

## Professional Focus
Strengthen the core ML engineering loop on AWS: training at scale, tuning, evaluation, tracking, and operational readiness.

## What This Enables Me To Do
- Understand deep learning fundamentals relevant to the exam\n- Choose metrics and interpret performance correctly\n- Use SageMaker HPO/AMT and AutoML approaches\n- Use Experiments, Debugger, Registry, TensorBoard\n- Understand scale patterns (warm pools, compiler, distributed training)

## AWS Services / Concepts Covered
- DL basics (CNNs/RNNs, activations, regularization)\n- Metrics (confusion matrix, precision/recall/F1/AUC, RMSE/MAE/R²)\n- SageMaker Automatic Model Tuning, Autopilot\n- SageMaker Experiments, Debugger, Model Registry\n- TensorBoard, distributed training concepts

## Interview-Ready Takeaways
- I can explain how I evaluate models (metrics + tradeoffs)\n- I understand AWS-native tooling for reproducibility and governance\n- I can discuss scaling training responsibly (cost/perf tradeoffs)
