# 06 — Model Training, Tuning, and Evaluation

## Professional Focus
Strengthen the core ML engineering loop on AWS: training at scale, tuning, evaluation, tracking, and operational readiness.

## What This Enables Me To Do
- Understand deep learning fundamentals relevant to the exam
- Choose metrics and interpret performance correctly
- Use SageMaker HPO/AMT and AutoML approaches\n- Use Experiments, Debugger, Registry, TensorBoard
- Understand scale patterns (warm pools, compiler, distributed training)

## AWS Services / Concepts Covered
- DL basics (CNNs/RNNs, activations, regularization)
- Metrics (confusion matrix, precision/recall/F1/AUC, RMSE/MAE/R²)
- SageMaker Automatic Model Tuning, Autopilot
- SageMaker Experiments, Debugger, Model Registry
- TensorBoard, distributed training concepts
