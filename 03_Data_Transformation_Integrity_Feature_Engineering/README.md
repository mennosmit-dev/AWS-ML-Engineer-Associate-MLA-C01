# 03 — Data Transformation, Integrity, and Feature Engineering

## Professional Focus
Build the ability to transform data at scale, ensure integrity, and engineer features using AWS-native tooling and big data systems.

## What This Enables Me To Do
- Perform feature engineering with awareness of dimensionality and leakage
- Use Spark/EMR concepts for scalable transformations\n- Use Glue + Athena for cataloging, transformation, and query-driven workflows
- Apply labeling and feature management patterns (Ground Truth, Feature Store)
- Add data quality thinking to transformation steps

## AWS Services / Concepts Covered
- EMR (Spark, Serverless)
- SageMaker Studio/Canvas/Data Wrangler\n
- Ground Truth + labeling approaches\n
- SageMaker Feature Store\n- AWS Glue (Studio, DataBrew, Data Quality)
- Amazon Athena + performance + access control
