# 03 — Data Transformation, Integrity, and Feature Engineering

## Professional Focus
Build the ability to transform data at scale, ensure integrity, and engineer features using AWS-native tooling and big data systems.

## What This Enables Me To Do
- Perform feature engineering with awareness of dimensionality and leakage\n- Use Spark/EMR concepts for scalable transformations\n- Use Glue + Athena for cataloging, transformation, and query-driven workflows\n- Apply labeling and feature management patterns (Ground Truth, Feature Store)\n- Add data quality thinking to transformation steps

## AWS Services / Concepts Covered
- EMR (Spark, Serverless)\n- SageMaker Studio/Canvas/Data Wrangler\n- Ground Truth + labeling approaches\n- SageMaker Feature Store\n- AWS Glue (Studio, DataBrew, Data Quality)\n- Amazon Athena + performance + access control

## Interview-Ready Takeaways
- I understand feature engineering patterns and how to scale them on AWS\n- I can explain how AWS Glue/Athena fit into ML data workflows\n- I can discuss label generation and feature store value in production

## Lecture Map (for navigation)
- EMR + Spark + labs (TF-IDF prep)\n- Handling missing/unbalanced data + outliers\n- Encoding/scaling/shuffling\n- SageMaker overview + Studio/Canvas/Wrangler\n- Model Monitor + Clarify + SHAP concepts\n- Feature Store\n- Glue + DataBrew + Data Quality + PII handling\n- Athena (CTAS, performance, ACID, fine-grained access)\n- Quiz
