# 01 — Introduction and Setup

## Professional Focus
Set up the learning environment the same way you’d set up a real cloud project: cost awareness, billing safety, and stable access to AWS.

## What This Enables Me To Do
- Start an AWS-based ML project with guardrails (budgeting and cost alerts)\n- Avoid common setup mistakes that cause runaway spend\n- Organize course materials like an engineer: repeatable and referenceable

## AWS Services / Concepts Covered
- AWS account basics\n- Billing alarms and cost visibility\n- Console UI changes (operational awareness)

## Interview-Ready Takeaways
- I treat cost controls as a first-class engineering requirement\n- I set up guardrails before experimentation, which is how production teams avoid surprises
