**Section:** 10 — Security, Identity, and Compliance

# 10 — Security, Identity, and Compliance

## Professional Focus
Build security-first habits: IAM, encryption, network isolation, compliance controls — for ML systems handling sensitive data.

## What This Enables Me To Do
- Apply least privilege via IAM users, roles, policies, and MFA\n- Implement encryption at rest/in transit (KMS)\n- Design secure VPC networking patterns\n- Use WAF/Shield and secrets management\n- Understand data masking/anonymization and compliance constraints

## AWS Services / Concepts Covered
- IAM (users/groups/policies/roles/MFA)\n- SageMaker security + VPC\n- KMS, encryption basics\n- Macie, Secrets Manager\n- WAF, Shield\n- VPC, subnets, gateways, endpoints, flow logs, PrivateLink

## Interview-Ready Takeaways
- I treat security as part of the ML system design, not an afterthought\n- I can explain IAM and networking decisions clearly and safely
