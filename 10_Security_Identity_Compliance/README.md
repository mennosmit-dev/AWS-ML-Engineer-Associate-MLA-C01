- Apply least privilege via IAM users, roles, policies, and MFA
- Implement encryption at rest/in transit (KMS)
- Design secure VPC networking patterns
- Use WAF/Shield and secrets management
- Understand data masking/anonymization and compliance constraints

## AWS Services / Concepts Covered
- IAM (users/groups/policies/roles/MFA)
- SageMaker security + VPC
- KMS, encryption basics
- Macie, Secrets Manager
- WAF, Shield
- VPC, subnets, gateways, endpoints, flow logs, PrivateLink
