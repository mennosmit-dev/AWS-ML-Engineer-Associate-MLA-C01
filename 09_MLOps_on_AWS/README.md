# 09 — MLOps on AWS

## Professional Focus
Learn how AWS production ML actually runs: deployment patterns, scaling, monitoring, automation, and orchestration.

## What This Enables Me To Do
- Deploy models using SageMaker patterns (variants, pipelines, serverless)
- Use monitoring and data capture for production visibility
- Choose compute and scaling strategies (spot, autoscaling)
- Understand containerization and orchestration (ECS/EKS/ECR)
- Automate via infrastructure as code and pipelines (CFN/CDK/CodePipeline)
- Orchestrate workflows (EventBridge, Step Functions, MWAA)

## AWS Services / Concepts Covered
- SageMaker deployment (variants, pipelines, serverless inference)
- Model Monitor + data capture
- Docker, ECS/EKS/ECR, Batch
- CloudFormation, CDK
- CodeDeploy/Build/Pipeline
- EventBridge, Step Functions, MWAA
- Lake Formation basics
