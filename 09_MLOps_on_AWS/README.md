# 09 — MLOps on AWS

## Professional Focus
Learn how AWS production ML actually runs: deployment patterns, scaling, monitoring, automation, and orchestration.

## What This Enables Me To Do
- Deploy models using SageMaker patterns (variants, pipelines, serverless)\n- Use monitoring and data capture for production visibility\n- Choose compute and scaling strategies (spot, autoscaling)\n- Understand containerization and orchestration (ECS/EKS/ECR)\n- Automate via infrastructure as code and pipelines (CFN/CDK/CodePipeline)\n- Orchestrate workflows (EventBridge, Step Functions, MWAA)

## AWS Services / Concepts Covered
- SageMaker deployment (variants, pipelines, serverless inference)\n- Model Monitor + data capture\n- Docker, ECS/EKS/ECR, Batch\n- CloudFormation, CDK\n- CodeDeploy/Build/Pipeline\n- EventBridge, Step Functions, MWAA\n- Lake Formation basics

## Interview-Ready Takeaways
- I can explain ML deployment tradeoffs and how I’d choose an approach\n- I can talk about “operating ML” (monitoring, scaling, automation)\n- I understand AWS MLOps as an ecosystem, not just one service
