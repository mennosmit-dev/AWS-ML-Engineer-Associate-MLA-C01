**Section:** 02 — Data Ingestion and Storage

# 02 — Data Ingestion and Storage

## Professional Focus
Learn how to ingest and store data in ways that support training, feature engineering, governance, and scalable ML workloads.

## What This Enables Me To Do
- Choose storage architecture that matches ML workloads (warehouse vs lake vs lakehouse)
- Implement secure, versioned, lifecycle-managed storage on S3
- Handle streaming ingestion (Kinesis/MSK/Flink) for near real-time ML use cases
- Make storage decisions with security and cost tradeoffs in mind

## AWS Services / Concepts Covered
- Amazon S3 (policies, encryption, versioning, replication, lifecycle, access points)
- EBS/EFS/FSx tradeoffs\n- Kinesis Data Streams + Firehose\n- Managed Service for Apache Flink
- Amazon MSK (Kafka) and comparisons
