**Section:** 02 — Data Ingestion and Storage

# 02 — Data Ingestion and Storage

## Professional Focus
Learn how to ingest and store data in ways that support training, feature engineering, governance, and scalable ML workloads.

## What This Enables Me To Do
- Choose storage architecture that matches ML workloads (warehouse vs lake vs lakehouse)\n- Implement secure, versioned, lifecycle-managed storage on S3\n- Handle streaming ingestion (Kinesis/MSK/Flink) for near real-time ML use cases\n- Make storage decisions with security and cost tradeoffs in mind

## AWS Services / Concepts Covered
- Amazon S3 (policies, encryption, versioning, replication, lifecycle, access points)\n- EBS/EFS/FSx tradeoffs\n- Kinesis Data Streams + Firehose\n- Managed Service for Apache Flink\n- Amazon MSK (Kafka) and comparisons

## Interview-Ready Takeaways
- I can explain which AWS storage service fits which ML scenario and why\n- I can describe secure-by-default S3 setups (policy, encryption, access)\n- I understand streaming ingestion options and operational tradeoffs

## Lecture Map (for navigation)
- Data types + the “3 Vs”\n- Warehouses/Lakes/Lakehouses + Data Mesh\n- ETL pipelines and orchestration concepts\n- S3 deep dive: security, versioning, replication, storage classes, lifecycle, events, performance, encryption, access points, object lambda\n- EBS/EFS/FSx\n- Kinesis Streams/Firehose/Flink + tuning\n- MSK + variants\n- Quiz
